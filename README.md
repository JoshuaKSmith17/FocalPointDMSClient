# FocalPointDMSClient
GUI client built with WPF to consume the FocalPointDMSWebServer REST API.  Initial project goals are to implement create, read, update, and delete actions
with the server for all entities that will be contained within the database.  The server-client will act as a sort of Dealer Management Solution that is
focused on off-highway equipment.

The current goal is to have the ability to accururately display every database entity within this screen.  Additional GUI elements will be built that 
focus on managing an individual record or adding new records.

This project is still in the early stage.  Currently, there are full CRUD implementations for only Customer Entities.  Current short term goal expand this functionality to other entities while expanding the entities the program handles.
